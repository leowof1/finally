# FinAlly — AI Trading Workstation

## Project Specification

## 1. Vision

FinAlly (Finance Ally) is a visually stunning AI-powered trading workstation that streams live market data, lets users trade a simulated portfolio, and integrates an LLM chat assistant that can analyze positions and execute trades on the user's behalf. It looks and feels like a modern Bloomberg terminal with an AI copilot.

This is the capstone project for an agentic AI coding course. It is built entirely by Coding Agents demonstrating how orchestrated AI agents can produce a production-quality full-stack application. Agents interact through files in `planning/`.

## 2. User Experience

### First Launch

The user runs a single Docker command (or a provided start script). A browser opens to `http://localhost:8000`. No login, no signup. They immediately see:

- A watchlist of 10 default tickers with live-updating prices in a grid
- $10,000 in virtual cash
- A dark, data-rich trading terminal aesthetic
- An AI chat panel ready to assist

### What the User Can Do

- **Watch prices stream** — prices flash green (uptick) or red (downtick) with subtle CSS animations that fade
- **View sparkline mini-charts** — price action beside each ticker in the watchlist, accumulated on the frontend from the SSE stream since page load (sparklines fill in progressively)
- **Click a ticker** to see a larger detailed chart in the main chart area
- **Buy and sell shares** — market orders only, instant fill at current price, no fees, no confirmation dialog
- **Monitor their portfolio** — a heatmap (treemap) showing positions sized by weight and colored by P&L, plus a P&L chart tracking total portfolio value over time
- **View a positions table** — ticker, quantity, average cost, current price, unrealized P&L, % change
- **Chat with the AI assistant** — ask about their portfolio, get analysis, and have the AI execute trades and manage the watchlist through natural language
- **Manage the watchlist** — add/remove tickers manually or via the AI chat

### Visual Design

- **Dark theme**: backgrounds around `#0d1117` or `#1a1a2e`, muted gray borders, no pure black
- **Price flash animations**: brief green/red background highlight on price change, fading over ~500ms via CSS transitions
- **Connection status indicator**: a small colored dot (green = connected, yellow = reconnecting, red = disconnected) visible in the header
- **Professional, data-dense layout**: inspired by Bloomberg/trading terminals — every pixel earns its place
- **Responsive but desktop-first**: optimized for wide screens, functional on tablet

### Color Scheme
- Accent Yellow: `#ecad0a`
- Blue Primary: `#209dd7`
- Purple Secondary: `#753991` (submit buttons)

## 3. Architecture Overview

### Single Container, Single Port

```

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, built as a static export (`output: 'export'`), served by FastAPI as static files
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), managed as a `uv` project
- **Database**: SQLite, single file at `db/finally.db`, volume-mounted for persistence
- **Real-time data**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) — simpler than WebSockets, one-way server→client push, works everywhere
- **AI integration**: LiteLLM → OpenRouter (Cerebras for fast inference), with structured outputs for trade execution
- **Market data**: Environment-variable driven — simulator by default, real data via Massive API if key provided

### Why These Choices

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| SSE over WebSockets | One-way push is all we need; simpler, no bidirectional complexity, universal browser support |
| Static Next.js export | Single origin, no CORS issues, one port, one container, simple deployment |
| SQLite over Postgres | No auth = no multi-user = no need for a database server; self-contained, zero config |
| Single Docker container | Students run one command; no docker-compose for production, no service orchestration |
| uv for Python | Fast, modern Python project management; reproducible lockfile; what students should learn |
| Market orders only | Eliminates order book, limit order logic, partial fills — dramatically simpler portfolio math |

### Key Boundaries

- **`frontend/`** is a self-contained Next.js project. It knows nothing about Python. It talks to the backend via `/api/*` endpoints and `/api/stream/*` SSE endpoints. Internal structure is up to the Frontend Engineer agent.
- **`backend/`** is a self-contained uv project with its own `pyproject.toml`. It owns all server logic including database initialization, schema, seed data, API routes, SSE streaming, market data, and LLM integration. Internal structure is up to the Backend/Market Data agents.
- **`backend/app/database/`** contains schema SQL definitions and seed logic. The backend lazily initializes the database on first request — creating tables and seeding default data if the SQLite file doesn't exist or is empty.
- **`db/`** at the top level is where the SQLite file (`db/finally.db`) lives during local development (outside Docker). In Docker, the database lives in the named volume `finally-data` mounted at `/app/db` (see Section 11).
- **`planning/`** contains project-wide documentation, including this plan. All agents reference files here as the shared contract.
- **`test/`** contains Playwright E2E tests and supporting infrastructure (e.g., `docker-compose.test.yml`). Unit tests live within `frontend/` and `backend/` respectively, following each framework's conventions.
- **`scripts/`** contains start/stop scripts that wrap Docker commands. Windows PowerShell equivalents are a deferred stretch goal.

## 5. Environment Variables

```bash
# Required: OpenRouter API key for LLM chat functionality
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here

# Optional: Massive (Polygon.io) API key for real market data
# If not set, the built-in market simulator is used (recommended for most users)
MASSIVE_API_KEY=

# Optional: Set to "true" for deterministic mock LLM responses (testing)
LLM_MOCK=false

# Optional: SQLite file path. Default: db/finally.db relative to the project root.
# The Dockerfile sets DB_PATH=/app/db/finally.db.
DB_PATH=
```

### Behavior

- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is set and non-empty → backend uses Massive REST API for market data
- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is absent or empty → backend uses the built-in market simulator
- If `LLM_MOCK=true` → backend returns deterministic mock LLM responses (for E2E tests)
- If `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is missing and `LLM_MOCK` is not `true` → `/api/chat` returns an error (see Section 9); everything else works normally
- In Docker, variables are passed with `docker run --env-file .env` (the file is not mounted). In local development, the backend loads `.env` from the project root.

---

## 6. Market Data

### Two Implementations, One Interface

Both the simulator and the Massive client implement the same abstract interface. The backend selects which to use based on the environment variable. All downstream code (SSE streaming, price cache, frontend) is agnostic to the source.

### Tracked Tickers

The market data source tracks the **union of watchlist tickers and tickers with an open position**. Removing a ticker from the watchlist while still holding it keeps its price updating, so the positions table and portfolio value stay correct.

### Ticker Validation

- Tickers are uppercased and must match `^[A-Z][A-Z.]{0,9}$` (e.g. `AAPL`, `BRK.B`); otherwise the request fails with 400
- **Simulator**: accepts any valid-format ticker. Unknown tickers get a random seed price between $50 and $300 and default volatility
- **Massive**: when a ticker is added, the backend fetches a one-off snapshot for it. If Massive returns no data, the add fails with 400 `Unknown ticker`

### Simulator (Default)

- Generates prices using geometric Brownian motion (GBM) with configurable drift and volatility per ticker
- Updates at ~500ms intervals
- Starts from realistic seed prices (e.g., AAPL ~$190, GOOGL ~$175, etc.)
- Runs as an in-process background task — no external dependencies
- **Second increment** (after plain GBM works and is tested): correlated moves across tickers (e.g., tech stocks move together) and occasional random "events" — sudden 2-5% moves on a ticker for drama

### Massive API (Optional)

- REST API polling (not WebSocket) — simpler, works on all tiers
- One request per poll: the multi-ticker snapshot endpoint (`/v2/snapshot/locale/us/markets/stocks/tickers?tickers=AAPL,MSFT,...`) for all tracked tickers, never one call per ticker
- Free tier (5 calls/min): poll every 15 seconds
- Paid tiers: poll every 2-15 seconds depending on tier
- Parses REST response into the same format as the simulator

### Shared Price Cache

- A single background task (simulator or Massive poller) writes to an in-memory price cache
- For each ticker the cache holds: `price`, `previous_price` (price at the previous update), `reference_price`, and `timestamp` (time of the last update)
- `reference_price` is the basis for "daily change %": the seed price at startup for the simulator, the previous day's close for Massive
- SSE streams read from this cache and push updates to connected clients
- This architecture supports future multi-user scenarios without changes to the data layer

### SSE Streaming

- Endpoint: `GET /api/stream/prices`
- Long-lived SSE connection; client uses native `EventSource` API
- Every ~500ms the server sends **one event containing the full snapshot of all tracked tickers** (no diffing, no per-client state)
- Event payload (`data:` line), a JSON object keyed by ticker:

```json
{
  "AAPL": {
    "price": 190.12,
    "previous_price": 190.05,
    "change_percent": 0.35,
    "direction": "up",
    "timestamp": "2026-10-14T13:30:00.500Z"
  }
}
```

- `direction` is `"up"`, `"down"` or `"flat"` (price vs. `previous_price`); `change_percent` is vs. `reference_price`
- With Massive polling every 15s, SSE resends unchanged entries. The frontend flashes a price and appends a chart point **only when `timestamp` changes** for that ticker
- Client handles reconnection automatically (EventSource has built-in retry)

### Timestamps

All timestamps everywhere (database, REST, SSE) are ISO 8601 UTC strings, e.g. `2026-10-14T13:30:00.500Z`.

---

## 7. Database

### SQLite with Lazy Initialization

The backend checks for the SQLite database on startup (or first request). If the file doesn't exist or tables are missing, it creates the schema and seeds default data. This means:

- No separate migration step
- No manual database setup
- Fresh Docker volumes start with a clean, seeded database automatically

### Schema

All tables include a `user_id` column defaulting to `"default"`. This is hardcoded for now (single-user) but enables future multi-user support without schema migration.

**users_profile** — User state (cash balance)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (default: `"default"`)
- `cash_balance` REAL (default: `10000.0`)
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**watchlist** — Tickers the user is watching
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `added_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`

**positions** — Current holdings (one row per ticker per user)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `avg_cost` REAL
- `updated_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`

**trades** — Trade history (append-only log)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `side` TEXT (`"buy"` or `"sell"`)
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `price` REAL
- `executed_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**portfolio_snapshots** — Portfolio value over time (for P&L chart). Recorded once at startup, every 30 seconds by a background task, and immediately after each trade execution.
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `total_value` REAL
- `recorded_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**chat_messages** — Conversation history with LLM
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `role` TEXT (`"user"` or `"assistant"`)
- `content` TEXT
- `actions` TEXT (JSON — `{"trades": [...], "watchlist_changes": [...]}` with the same result shape as the `/api/chat` response; null for user messages)
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

### Default Seed Data

- One user profile: `id="default"`, `cash_balance=10000.0`
- Ten watchlist entries: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, JPM, V, NFLX

## 8. API Endpoints

### Market Data
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/stream/prices` | SSE stream of live price updates |

### Portfolio
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/portfolio` | Current positions, cash balance, total value, unrealized P&L |
| POST | `/api/portfolio/trade` | Execute a trade: `{ticker, quantity, side}` |
| GET | `/api/portfolio/history` | Portfolio value snapshots over time (for P&L chart) |

### Watchlist
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/watchlist` | Current watchlist tickers with latest prices |
| POST | `/api/watchlist` | Add a ticker: `{ticker}` |
| DELETE | `/api/watchlist/{ticker}` | Remove a ticker |

### Chat
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/chat` | Send a message, receive complete JSON response (message + executed actions) |
| GET | `/api/chat/history` | Stored conversation, so the chat panel survives a page reload |

### System
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check (for Docker/deployment) |

Errors use FastAPI's default shape: `{"detail": "Human-readable message"}`.

### Trade Rules

Manual trades and LLM trades share one code path with these rules:

- `quantity` > 0 (fractional allowed); `side` is `"buy"` or `"sell"`
- The ticker must have a price in the cache (i.e. be on the watchlist or held), else 400 `No price for XYZ; add it to the watchlist first`
- Fill price = current cached price
- Buy: requires `quantity * price <= cash_balance`, else 400 `Insufficient cash`
- Sell: requires `quantity <= held quantity`, else 400 `Insufficient shares`
- Buy updates `avg_cost` as a weighted average: `(old_qty * old_avg + qty * price) / (old_qty + qty)`. Sell leaves `avg_cost` unchanged
- When a position's quantity drops below `1e-9`, its row is deleted
- Each trade appends to `trades` and records a portfolio snapshot

### Response Shapes

Portfolio math: `market_value = quantity * current_price`, `unrealized_pnl = market_value - quantity * avg_cost`, `pnl_percent = (current_price - avg_cost) / avg_cost * 100`, `total_value = cash_balance + sum(market_value)`.

**`GET /api/portfolio`** → 200

```json
{
  "cash_balance": 8082.50,
  "total_value": 10012.50,
  "unrealized_pnl": 12.50,
  "positions": [
    {"ticker": "AAPL", "quantity": 10, "avg_cost": 190.50, "current_price": 191.75,
     "market_value": 1917.50, "unrealized_pnl": 12.50, "pnl_percent": 0.66}
  ]
}
```

**`POST /api/portfolio/trade`** — body `{"ticker": "AAPL", "quantity": 10, "side": "buy"}` → 200

```json
{
  "trade": {"id": "uuid", "ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 10, "price": 190.50,
            "executed_at": "2026-10-14T13:30:00.500Z"},
  "portfolio": { "...": "same shape as GET /api/portfolio" }
}
```

**`GET /api/portfolio/history`** → 200, oldest first

```json
[{"total_value": 10000.00, "recorded_at": "2026-10-14T13:30:00.000Z"}]
```

**`GET /api/watchlist`** → 200. `price` and `change_percent` are null until the first price arrives.

```json
[{"ticker": "AAPL", "price": 190.12, "change_percent": 0.35}]
```

**`POST /api/watchlist`** — body `{"ticker": "PYPL"}` → 201 with `{"ticker": "PYPL", "price": 61.20, "change_percent": 0.0}`; 400 for invalid or unknown ticker. Adding a ticker that is already on the watchlist is a silent success: 200 with the same body.

**`DELETE /api/watchlist/{ticker}`** → 204; 404 if not on the watchlist.

**`POST /api/chat`** — body `{"message": "Buy 10 AAPL"}` → 200

```json
{
  "message": "Bought 10 AAPL at $190.50.",
  "trades": [
    {"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 10, "price": 190.50, "status": "executed", "error": null}
  ],
  "watchlist_changes": [
    {"ticker": "PYPL", "action": "add", "status": "executed", "error": null}
  ]
}
```

Failed actions have `"status": "failed"`, `price: null` for trades, and the same error text the REST endpoints would return (e.g. `"Insufficient cash"`). Chat errors: 503 if `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is missing (and not in mock mode); 502 if the LLM call fails or returns unparseable output.

**`GET /api/chat/history`** → 200, oldest first, all stored messages. `actions` uses the same shape as the `trades` / `watchlist_changes` of the `POST /api/chat` response, and is null for user messages.

```json
[
  {"id": "uuid", "role": "user", "content": "Buy 10 AAPL", "actions": null,
   "created_at": "2026-10-14T13:30:00.000Z"},
  {"id": "uuid", "role": "assistant", "content": "Bought 10 AAPL at $190.50.",
   "actions": {"trades": ["..."], "watchlist_changes": []}, "created_at": "2026-10-14T13:30:00.800Z"}
]
```

**`GET /api/health`** → 200 `{"status": "ok"}`

## 9. LLM Integration

When writing code to make calls to LLMs, use cerebras-inference skill to use LiteLLM via OpenRouter to the `openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-120b` model with Cerebras as the inference provider. Structured Outputs should be used to interpret the results.

There is an OPENROUTER_API_KEY in the .env file in the project root.

### How It Works

When the user sends a chat message, the backend:

1. Loads the user's current portfolio context (cash, positions with P&L, watchlist with live prices, total portfolio value)
2. Loads the last 20 messages from the `chat_messages` table
3. Constructs a prompt with a system message, portfolio context, conversation history, and the user's new message
4. Calls the LLM via LiteLLM → OpenRouter, requesting structured output, using the cerebras-inference skill
5. Parses the complete structured JSON response
6. Auto-executes watchlist changes first, then trades (so the LLM can add a ticker and trade it in one response). Each action runs independently; one failure does not stop the others
7. Stores the user message, and the assistant message with its action results, in `chat_messages`
8. Returns the complete JSON response to the frontend in the shape defined in Section 8 (no token-by-token streaming — Cerebras inference is fast enough that a loading indicator is sufficient)

If the LLM call fails or its output can't be parsed, the endpoint returns 502 and nothing is executed or stored.

### Structured Output Schema

The LLM is instructed to respond with JSON matching this schema:

```json
{
  "message": "Your conversational response to the user",
  "trades": [
    {"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 10}
  ],
  "watchlist_changes": [
    {"ticker": "PYPL", "action": "add"}
  ]
}
```

- `message` (required): The conversational text shown to the user
- `trades` (optional): Array of trades to auto-execute. Each trade goes through the same validation as manual trades (sufficient cash for buys, sufficient shares for sells)
- `watchlist_changes` (optional): Array of watchlist modifications

### Auto-Execution

Trades specified by the LLM execute automatically — no confirmation dialog. This is a deliberate design choice:
- It's a simulated environment with fake money, so the stakes are zero
- It creates an impressive, fluid demo experience
- It demonstrates agentic AI capabilities — the core theme of the course

If a trade fails validation (e.g., insufficient cash), the error is included in the chat response so the LLM can inform the user.

### System Prompt Guidance

The LLM should be prompted as "FinAlly, an AI trading assistant" with instructions to:
- Analyze portfolio composition, risk concentration, and P&L
- Suggest trades with reasoning
- Execute trades when the user asks or agrees
- Manage the watchlist proactively
- Be concise and data-driven in responses
- Always respond with valid structured JSON

### LLM Mock Mode

When `LLM_MOCK=true`, the backend returns deterministic mock responses instead of calling OpenRouter. The actions in these responses still go through the normal execution path:

- Message contains "buy" (case-insensitive) → `{"message": "Buying 1 share of AAPL.", "trades": [{"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 1}], "watchlist_changes": []}`
- Anything else → `{"message": "Hello! I'm FinAlly, your AI trading assistant.", "trades": [], "watchlist_changes": []}`

This enables:
- Fast, free, reproducible E2E tests
- Development without an API key
- CI/CD pipelines

---

## 10. Frontend Design

### Layout

The frontend is a single-page application with a dense, terminal-inspired layout. The specific component architecture and layout system is up to the Frontend Engineer, but the UI should include these elements:

- **Watchlist panel** — grid/table of watched tickers with: ticker symbol, current price (flashing green/red on change), daily change % (`change_percent` from SSE), and a sparkline mini-chart (accumulated from SSE since page load)
- **Main chart area** — larger chart for the currently selected ticker, with at minimum price over time. Clicking a ticker in the watchlist selects it here. Data comes from the same frontend price buffer as the sparklines (there is no backend price-history endpoint).
- **Portfolio heatmap** — treemap visualization where each rectangle is a position, sized by portfolio weight, colored by P&L (green = profit, red = loss)
- **P&L chart** — line chart showing total portfolio value over time, using data from `portfolio_snapshots`
- **Positions table** — tabular view of all positions: ticker, quantity, avg cost, current price, unrealized P&L, % change (`pnl_percent`, i.e. vs. avg cost)
- **Trade bar** — simple input area: ticker field, quantity field, buy button, sell button. Market orders, instant fill.
- **AI chat panel** — docked/collapsible sidebar. Message input, scrolling conversation history (loaded from `GET /api/chat/history` on page load), loading indicator while waiting for LLM response. Trade executions and watchlist changes shown inline as confirmations.
- **Header** — portfolio total value (updating live), connection status indicator, cash balance

### Technical Notes

- Use `EventSource` for SSE connection to `/api/stream/prices`
- Charts: Recharts for everything: `LineChart` for the main price chart, the P&L chart and the sparklines, `Treemap` for the portfolio heatmap. Disable Recharts animations on live-updating charts so 500ms updates don't stutter
- Price buffer: per ticker, keep the last 1,000 points (about 8 minutes at 500ms). Append a point only when the ticker's SSE `timestamp` changes
- Price flash effect: when a ticker's SSE `timestamp` changes and its price differs from the displayed one, briefly apply a CSS class with background color transition, then remove it
- All API calls go to the same origin (`/api/*`) — no CORS configuration needed
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom dark theme

---

## 11. Docker & Deployment

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile

```
Stage 1: Node 24 (LTS) slim
  - Copy frontend/
  - npm ci && npm run build (produces static export)

Stage 2: Python 3.14 slim
  - Install uv
  - Copy backend/
  - uv sync (install Python dependencies from lockfile)
  - Copy frontend build output into a static/ directory
  - ENV DB_PATH=/app/db/finally.db
  - Expose port 8000
  - CMD: uvicorn serving FastAPI app
```

FastAPI serves the static frontend files and all API routes on port 8000.

### Docker Volume

The SQLite database persists via a named Docker volume:

```bash
docker run -v finally-data:/app/db -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env finally
```

The named volume `finally-data` is mounted at `/app/db` in the container, and the backend writes `finally.db` there (`DB_PATH`). The project-root `db/` directory is not used by Docker; it is only the local-development default.

### Start/Stop Scripts

**`scripts/start_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Builds the Docker image if not already built (or if `--build` flag passed)
- Runs the container with the volume mount, port mapping, and `.env` file
- Prints the URL to access the app
- Optionally opens the browser

**`scripts/stop_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Stops and removes the running container
- Does NOT remove the volume (data persists)

All scripts should be idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

There is no root `docker-compose.yml`; the scripts are the supported way to run the app. Windows PowerShell scripts (`start_windows.ps1` / `stop_windows.ps1`) are deferred as a stretch goal; Windows users can run the `docker run` command above directly.

### Optional Cloud Deployment

The container is designed to deploy to AWS App Runner, Render, or any container platform. A Terraform configuration for App Runner may be provided in a `deploy/` directory as a stretch goal, but is not part of the core build.

## 12. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (within `frontend/` and `backend/`)

**Backend (pytest)**:
- Market data: simulator generates valid prices, GBM math is correct, Massive API response parsing works, both implementations conform to the abstract interface
- Portfolio: trade execution logic, P&L calculations, edge cases (selling more than owned, buying with insufficient cash, selling at a loss)
- LLM: structured output parsing handles all valid schemas, graceful handling of malformed responses, trade validation within chat flow
- API routes: correct status codes, response shapes, error handling

**Frontend (React Testing Library or similar)**:
- Component rendering with mock data
- Price flash animation triggers correctly on price changes
- Watchlist CRUD operations
- Portfolio display calculations
- Chat message rendering and loading state

### E2E Tests (in `test/`)

**Infrastructure**: A separate `docker-compose.test.yml` in `test/` that spins up the app container plus a Playwright container. This keeps browser dependencies out of the production image.

**Environment**: Tests run with `LLM_MOCK=true` by default for speed and determinism.

**Key Scenarios**:
- Fresh start: default watchlist appears, $10k balance shown, prices are streaming
- Add and remove a ticker from the watchlist
- Buy shares: cash decreases, position appears, portfolio updates
- Sell shares: cash increases, position updates or disappears
- Portfolio visualization: heatmap renders with correct colors, P&L chart has data points
- AI chat (mocked): send a message, receive a response, trade execution appears inline
- Connection status: the header dot turns green once the SSE stream is connected

SSE reconnection (stop and restart the container, verify the dot goes yellow/red and back to green) is a manual check, not an automated test.
